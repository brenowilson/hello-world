Learning how to use GitHub.

Hello, my name is Breno and I never used GitHub as a form of repository for my projects.

I'm the founder of Universidade Funil and I'm starting a real project, so I need to maintain the history of the changes of the files with the team.

I used Git and Subversion on other projects on a centralized server, but I see GitHub as a more open community when I need to contribute or to receive contribution.

I studied Computer Science once, but exited from graduation at the last period because of some circunstances in my life and I did worked on many projects since I started.

Now, I want to open something and also help the community for the advance of the ones who needs help in their projects and also receive help in my own projects when needed.

I'm married with Pamela and I do have a little daugther too. I think that's all for now :)
